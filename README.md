# Code Refactor Starter Code
Changed HTML to include semantic elements. changed multiple divs to sections to show how other elements were nested inside them. changed header and footer divs to "header" & "footer".
removed some classes that were not required in the HTML to simplify the code. These classes were not needed for css formating. css formating for these classes (content & benefits sections) were able to be combined into one for each section tag type.
reordered some css sections to clearly match html structure.
Changed title to reflect content.
added "alt" to all images to provide text if image fails to load.
